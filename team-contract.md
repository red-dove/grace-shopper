## Roles
All roles shared by all team members:
Taskmaster
Gitmaster
Testmaster


## Team expectations
### Disagreements...
We get together and discuss as a group. We resolve issues after agreeing on it together. We do not move foreward until we are all on agreement.


### Frustrations...
We get together and talk and talk about it. We make sure we are all on the same page. If we can’t resolve it after talking about it quickly, we take 5 minutes to walk and then get back together to discuss.

If someone is not pulling their weight, it is most likely because the person is stuck and communicating about their work will resolve it.


### Code merges...
If you are pair programming, the other pair should look at the code that was written. If you are working individually, then everyone should need to look at it.

If we have merge conflicts, we all look at it together.

For now, if we merge to master, we all look at it together so we are all on the same page.


### Seeking help…
If you work on a pair and can’t do something in 10-15 minutes, then you ask your teammates. If your entire team cannot figure it out after an additional 5-10 minutes, then you put in a help desk ticket. Special cases for silent errors, and configuring things.


### Pairing…
We should start pairing and then either pair or work individually. The duration of how long we pair should be based on the complexity of the feature rather than time.

### After hours…
Run work on your local machine and do not push to master (or try to) until you get speak with other teammates.

### Daily Standup…
11am so that we have time to work on issues before we gather as a group and discuss.
